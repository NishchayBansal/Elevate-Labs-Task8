**Task 8: Working and understanding VPN**

**Objective:** Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

**Tools:** Free VPN client (ProtonVPN free tier, Windscribe free)

**Deliverables:** Report describing VPN setup steps and connection status screenshot.



**1. Choose a reputable free VPN service and sign up.**

Here for our working, we chose “Windscribe”.

**6. Disconnect VPN and compare browsing speed and IP.**

**IP:** IP address changes. 

**Browsing Speed :** Turning off a VPN resulted in a faster browsing speed, as the encryption and routing through a remote server no longer added latency. 
However, the speed increase is usually not drastic, and might only be noticeable during specific tasks like streaming/downloading large files. 

**7. Research VPN encryption and privacy features.**

VPN encryption and privacy features work together to secure your online data and activity. 
VPNs create encrypted tunnels, or virtual connections, that protect your data from unauthorized access while also concealing your IP address and masking your virtual location.

**_Encryption:_** 

**•Data Encryption:** VPNs use encryption to scramble your data, making it unreadable to anyone who might try to intercept it.

**•	Protocols:** Different VPN providers use various encryption protocols, like OpenVPN, IPsec, and L2TP/IPsec. 

**•	No-Logs Policy:** A no-logs policy, where VPN provider doesn't keep records of your online activities, enhancing privacy, ensuring your browsing history hidden. 

**_Privacy Features:_**

**•	IP Address Masking:** VPNs redirect your internet traffic through a remote server, assigning you a new IP address, effectively hiding real IP.

**•	Virtual Location:** You can choose a VPN server location to make it appear as if you're browsing from that location. 

**•	Anonymization:** VPNs help anonymize your online activity by masking your identity and location.

 
**8. Write a summary on VPN benefits and limitations.**

**Benefits:**
Enhanced Privacy, Secure Public Wi-fi, Bypassing Geo-blocks, Protection from Cyberattacks, Secure Remote Work,etc.

**Limitations:**
Slower Speeds, Subscription Costs, Not a Silver Bullet/ replacement for antivirus software, Potential Data Leaks, Geo-blocking Issues, Not Always Compatible,	Data Limits with Free VPNs.
